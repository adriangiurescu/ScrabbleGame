# ScrabbleGame

This is an imitation of the Scrabble game, designed by me along with four other colleagues within the project "Fostering the Transversal Digital Competences in Higher Education" (Acronym: FTDCHE)" Ref. Project: 2022-1-ES01-KA220-HED-000089861, led by the University of Malaga, where UNSTPB is a partner, alongside the University of Primorska (Slovenia) and the University College Leuven-Limburg (UCLL - Belgium).
